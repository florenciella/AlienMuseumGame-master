AlienMuseumGame
===============

Game for CodeDay 2014

The alien museum game!
Make sure you can clone the repo and get this file.
Things to do:
Install Monogame, which is the framework we'll be using
Install a compatible IDE, or ask me (Alex Sanchez-Stern, I'm in the brown button-up shirt) about setting up with a text editor.
You'll also probably want Tiled, the map editor.
